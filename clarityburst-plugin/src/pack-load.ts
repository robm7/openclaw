/**
 * Pack Load Helper Module
 *
 * Provides a helper function that wraps getPackForStage() with deterministic
 * error conversion for PackPolicyIncompleteError → ClarityBurstAbstainError.
 *
 * This module provides a single point for pack loading with consistent error
 * handling across all gating wrappers.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: This module is part of the foundational clarityburst layer.
 * It MUST NOT import from agents/ to maintain dependency-downward architecture.

/**
 * Loads an ontology pack for the given stage, converting PackPolicyIncompleteError
 * to ClarityBurstAbstainError with deterministic fields.
 *
 * INVARIANT: PackPolicyIncompleteError is always converted to ClarityBurstAbstainError
 * with { outcome:"ABSTAIN_CLARIFY", reason:"PACK_POLICY_INCOMPLETE", contractId:null }.
 * This ensures a malformed pack causes a blocked nonRetryable response (not an
 * unhandled exception).
 *
 * NO SIDE EFFECTS: This function only performs pack loading and validation.
 * It does not modify any state or call external services.
 *
 * @param stageId - The stage identifier to load the pack for
 * @returns The validated OntologyPack for the requested stage
 * @throws ClarityBurstAbstainError if the pack fails validation (PACK_POLICY_INCOMPLETE)
 * @throws Error if the stage_id is unknown (re-thrown from getPackForStage)
 *
 * @example
 * // In a gating wrapper:
 * const pack = loadPackOrAbstain("NETWORK_IO");
 * // If pack is malformed, ClarityBurstAbstainError is thrown automatically
 * // with deterministic { outcome, reason, contractId, instructions }
