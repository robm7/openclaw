# Router Service Production Deployment: Execution Strategy

**Document Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Planning Phase Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Next Action:** Phase 1 → Implementation phase (begin Phase 2-3 preparation)

---

## Executive Summary

The Router Service production deployment plan has been finalized with a **Kubernetes-based, active-passive HA architecture** targeting:

- **<200ms p99 latency**
- **99.95% uptime** (max 21.6 min downtime/month)
- **Automated failover** (primary → standby in <60 seconds)
- **Mirror staging environment** (dev → staging → production promotion pipeline)

| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1.1 Deployment Architecture** | ✅     | `ROUTER_SERVICE_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **1.2 TLS/HTTPS Strategy**      | ✅     | cert-manager + Let's Encrypt (auto-renewal)            |
| **1.3 Kubernetes Manifests**    | ✅     | Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PDB specs              |
| **1.4 Service Discovery & DNS** | ✅     | Route53 failover + CoreDNS (K8s internal)              |
| **1.5 HA/Failover Procedures**  | ✅     | Active-passive with health check monitoring            |
| **1.6 SLO/SLA Targets**         | ✅     | 99.95% uptime, <200ms p99, <0.1% error rate            |

### Key Architecture Decisions

```
Infrastructure:   Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) with 3 nodes (3 AZs)
Compute:          t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB) × 3 (prod), t3.small × 2 (staging)
High Availability: Active-passive (primary + standby replica)
Failover:         Route53 health checks + DNS failover (<60 seconds)
TLS:              cert-manager + Let's Encrypt (90-day, auto-renew)
Monitoring:       Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (open-source stack)
Load Balancer:    AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Service Mesh:     Not required for Phase 5 (future: Istio)
Cost Estimate:    ~$335/month (prod + staging)
```

## Recommended Work Stream Strategy

### ⚠️ Important: Sequential Phases with Parallel Workstreams

Based on your recommendation to balance **agent operation protection** (OPTION 1) with **router deployment** (OPTION 3), here's the suggested sequence:

```
Timeline Overview:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NOW (Week 1)          OPTION 1: NETWORK_IO Wiring (Phase 1)
                      └─ Wire 6 fetch commit points
                      └─ ~2-3 days

                      OPTION 2: CRON_SCHEDULE Gating (Phase 2)
                      └─ Complete Phase 2 ClarityBurst work
                      └─ ~1-2 days after OPTION 1

Phase 2 (Week 2-3)    OPTION 3: Router Deployment (PARALLEL)
                      ├─ Phase 1: Architecture planning ✅ COMPLETE
                      ├─ Phase 2: Infrastructure provisioning (→ EKS cluster)
                      ├─ Phase 3: CI/CD pipeline setup
                      └─ ~1-2 weeks, non-blocking OpenClaw work

Phase 3 (Week 4-5)    CONVERGENCE: Staging + Production
                      ├─ Phase 4: Staging validation (load test, failover)
                      ├─ Phase 5: Active-passive HA setup
                      ├─ Phase 6: Monitoring & observability
                      └─ ~1 week

Phase 4 (Week 6+)     PRODUCTION ROLLOUT (Phase 7)
                      ├─ 5% canary → 25% → 50% → 100%
                      ├─ Monitor 48 hours
                      └─ ~3-5 days
```

### Rationale: Why This Sequence Works

1. **OPTION 1 (NETWORK_IO)** is the most critical blocker for Phase 5 OpenClaw operation protection. Wire it first while Router deployment can proceed in parallel.

2. **OPTION 2 (CRON_SCHEDULE)** completes Phase 2 ClarityBurst. This is a prerequisite for Phase 3 rollout (router depends on complete gating framework).

3. **OPTION 3 (Router Deployment)** starts NOW but doesn't block OpenClaw. Infrastructure setup is parallel work that needs 2 weeks minimum. The gateway can continue using localhost:3001 until production cutover (Phase 7).

## Concurrent Work Streams (Recommended)

### Workstream A: OpenClaw Phase 5 Preparation (NOW)

**Owner:** Core Engineering Team  
**Timeline:** Week 1-2

1. **OPTION 1: NETWORK_IO Gating Wiring** (~2-3 days)
   - Wire 6 fetch commit points
   - Run NETWORK_IO tests
   - Validation: `pnpm test -- network_io` passes

2. **OPTION 2: CRON_SCHEDULE Gating** (~1-2 days after OPTION 1)
   - Complete Phase 2 ClarityBurst gating
   - Validation: All gating tests pass

3. **Impact on Router Deployment:** None—these are independent workstreams

### Workstream B: Router Infrastructure Deployment (NOW, PARALLEL)

**Owner:** DevOps / SRE Team  
**Timeline:** Week 1-8 (concurrent with OpenClaw work)

1. **Phases 2-3:** Infrastructure + CI/CD (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Phase 4-6:** Staging + HA + Monitoring (Weeks 4-6)
3. **Phase 7:** Production Rollout (Weeks 7-8)

**Non-Blocking:** The gateway can continue using `http://localhost:3001` while router deployment proceeds. Cutover happens only in Phase 7 (Week 7-8).

1. **Timeline:** Are 6-8 weeks (Phases 1-8) acceptable for production readiness?
2. **Infrastructure:** Confirm EKS (AWS) vs GKE (GCP) preference?
3. **Domain:** What domain should be used for `clarity-router.example.com`?
4. **On-Call:** Who will be primary/secondary on-call for router incidents?
5. **Budget:** Approve ~$335/month infrastructure cost?
6. **Rollout Window:** Preferred production cutover window (Phase 7)?
