2. **Domain:** What domain should clarity-router.example.com resolve to?
3. **Billing:** Is ~$335/month budget approved for infrastructure?
4. **Team:** Who will execute Phase 2 (DevOps/SRE)?
5. **Timeline:** What is the target completion date?
6. **Approval:** Who needs to sign off on Phase 2 completion?
