# Phase 4 Security Validation: Results Template

**Document:** Phase 4 Security Test Results Report  
**Date:** [TEST_DATE]  
**Test Run ID:** [TEST_ID]  
**Seed:** 42 (deterministic, reproducible)  
**Status:** [PASS | FAIL]

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 security testing validates three broader prompt injection attack categories:

1. **Retrieval Injection** — Agent retrieves malicious instructions from external data
2. **Data Injection** — User-supplied data contains instruction-like strings
3. **Configuration Injection** — Startup config modified to disable safety

**Verdict:** [✅ PASS | ❌ FAIL]

**Key Finding:** All [21 / ?] security tests passed. System is resistant to broader prompt injection variants.

```
[If all tests passed]

1. Retrieval Injection Resistance
   ✅ All 7 retrieval injection attempts were denied by router
   ✅ External data containing instructions did not change routing decision
   ✅ Agent behavior: calls router for all data-driven operations
   ✅ Side effects: 0 detected

2. Data Injection Resistance
   ✅ All 7 data injection attempts were stored as literal strings
   ✅ User-supplied data with instruction-like strings did not execute
   ✅ Data fields treated as data, not code
   ✅ Side effects: 0 detected

3. Configuration Injection Resistance
   ✅ All 7 configuration bypass attempts failed
   ✅ Safety mechanisms remained active regardless of config values

## Comparison to Phase 3 (Instruction Override)

| Aspect                | Phase 3                              | Phase 4                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Scope**             | Instruction override in request text | Retrieval, data, config injection |
| **Test Cases**        | 8                                    | 21                                |
| **Attack Categories** | 1                                    | 3                                 |

**Combined:** Phases 3 + 4 = Comprehensive prompt injection validation (instruction override + broader variants)

---

## Limitations & Assumptions

### What This Validation Assumes

1. ✅ Router is properly implemented
2. ✅ Agent uses router for all operations
3. ✅ Database is properly secured (parameterized queries)
4. ✅ Configuration file is protected from unauthorized access
5. ✅ Network isolation prevents MITM attacks

### What This Validation Does NOT Test

❌ Database-level injection (parameterized queries, DB security)  
❌ Configuration file protection (file permissions, access controls)  
❌ Network security (MITM attacks, TLS bypass)  
❌ LLM downstream interpretation (if LLM code interprets router output)  
❌ Human approval process (if human actually reviews decisions)

---

## Enterprise Implications

### Security Posture After Phase 4

**Before Phase 4:**

- ✅ Instruction override resistant (Phase 3)
- ❌ Retrieval injection untested
- ❌ Data injection untested
- ❌ Config injection untested

**After Phase 4:**

- ✅ Instruction override resistant (Phase 3)
- ✅ [Retrieval injection resistant | NOT YET | VULNERABLE]
- ✅ [Data injection resistant | NOT YET | VULNERABLE]
- ✅ [Config injection resistant | NOT YET | VULNERABLE]

---

## Recommendations

### If All Tests PASS ✅

1. ✅ Document broader prompt injection resistance
2. ✅ Update security posture claim from "instruction override resistant" to "prompt injection resistant (instruction, retrieval, data, config injection)"
3. ✅ Proceed to Phase 4 production deployment
4. ✅ Monitor in production for unexpected attack patterns
5. ✅ Schedule annual security re-validation

### If Tests FAIL ❌

1. ❌ Identify root cause of failure
2. ❌ Implement remediation:
   - For retrieval injection: Add agent validation that retrieves data calls router
   - For data injection: Add downstream data sanitization / interpretation guards
   - For config injection: Harden startup validation, make config immutable post-startup
3. ❌ Re-run test suite to verify fix
4. ❌ Document root cause and remediation in compliance artifacts
5. ❌ Defer production deployment until all tests pass
